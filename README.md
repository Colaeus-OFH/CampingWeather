# CampingWeather
Notes and testing for the Camping Weather shiny app.

For years a small group of us have indulged in an easy canoe trip on what is traditionally known as the “May two-four” weekend.
That time of the year in Nova Scotia can be sketchy; we’ve had everything from below freezing to wind and rain storms.
There are old expressions for the months of that season. It was hungry March or long-legged March, starve-gutted April and up May hill.

For much of Canada it marks the start of the summer season. Folks open their camps or cottages, chase out the mice and celebrate with a beer.
Traditionally a bottle from a “two four” or case of 24 bottles.

Out of curiosity I looked up the weather over the past few years from historical Environment Canada data in the areas we would camp.  That was the impetus
create  web app giving you the observations over ~9-10 years for a 4-day trip.
